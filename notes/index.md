This page is used to collect notes.

These are meant for quick and dirty collection of notes, ideas and information. I keep them public for my own ease of access, and if someone benefits from them. Factual accuracy is not guranteed in these notes.
However, I would welcome anyone to add or make minor changes to these notes. In that case, just send a pull request at the github repo https://github.com/iamaaditya/iamaaditya.github.io.
If you however prefer to email, then :: aprakash   @     brandeis     .     edu
