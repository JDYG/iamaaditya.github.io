This page is used to collect notes.

These are meant for quick and dirty collection of notes, ideas and information. I keep them public for my own ease of access; however you are welcome to read/copy the contents (MIT License) . Factual accuracy is not guranteed in these notes.
However, I would welcome anyone to add or make minor changes to these notes. In that case, just send a pull request at the github repo https://github.com/iamaaditya/iamaaditya.github.io
If you however prefer to email, then :: aprakash   @     brandeis     .     edu
