## Language Features

### **Word2Vec**

  * Projet website: https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
  * Description:
    This tool provides an efficient implementation of the continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram architectures for computing vector representations of words. These representations can be subsequently used in many natural language processing applications and for further research.

### **Glove**
 
  * Project website: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
  * Description: 
    GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
