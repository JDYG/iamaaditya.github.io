## What do they understand ?

 * They understand a decomposition of their visual input space as a hierarchical-modular network of convolution filters. [source](http://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html)
 * They understand a probabilitistic mapping between certain combinations of these filters and a set of arbitrary labels. [source](http://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html)
