# Deep Learning References

## Courses
 * [UVA Deep Learning course](http://uvadlc.github.io/). Contains easy to follow class video lectures, covers most of deep learning.
 * [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) Covers CNN only but in depth.

## Textbook
 * [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). Very thorough and well written book. Covers almost everything.
 * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). Light reading, only 6 chapters, easy to follow.
 * [Machine Learning](http://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf). For better understanding of ML concepts, easy to follow.
