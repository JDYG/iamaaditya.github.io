  <h1>Dokuwiki for Personal Notebook and Note taking</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>As a researcher, you soon start wondering if you had centralized all your notes, possibly digitized them, life would be much better. Recently when I had to make a tough choice of leaving all my notes from years when I am about to shift country <em>(due to limited air travel baggage)</em>, I wish I had them on computer. Since I will be making more notes in the future, at least a lesson is learnt. </p>

<p>For this reason, I started experimenting with different available tools. I tried Evernote, Catch.com, Microsoft Onenote and various personal wikis. Initially, I liked MS Onenote. Since it has several useful tools and very easy to use &#8216;capturing methods&#8217;. Later, I realized having it online would be more beneficial as I will be able to access it from anywhere and perhaps share it with friends/colleague if needed.</p>

<p>Then I started experimenting with several &#8216;wiki&#8217; sites. I tried &#8216;<a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" target="_blank">tiddlywiki</a>&#8216; &#8211; works great, very fluid, no installation, single file. But the idea that all the notes are in single file made me uncomfortable. I realized very soon these notes will be running thousands of pages and all of them in a single file will cause it to load very slowly. Also to have it online, I will have to give higher privileges to the file <em>(so that it can modify the source itself)</em>, which I didn&#8217;t like. &#8216;Mediawiki&#8217; (from Wikipedia.org) looked little overkill.</p>

<p><strong>Comparision of various personal wiki services/softwares</strong> is given <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/DokuWiki+MediaWiki+bLADE-Wiki+6of5-Wiki" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>Long story short, I ended up using <strong><a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org" target="_blank">Dokuwiki</a></strong>. Great <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/features" target="_blank">features</a>, many <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/features" target="_blank">plugins </a>and with little knowledge of php you can customize it with ease. Last but not least, great support for $ \LaTeX $</p>

<p>You can see my installation <em>(link given below)</em>, although the Notes are still in nascent stage, but I soon expect it to be full of information and my personal notes, especially in Maths and Computer Science.</p>

<p><a href="http://aaditya.info/wiki" title="Personal Notebook using Dokuwiki" target="_blank">My Personal Notebook using Dokuwiki</a></p>

<p>This also means, I will not be using this blog anymore for personal notes. My initial notes and rough drafts will be in wiki and final and polished articles will be in this blog.</p>
