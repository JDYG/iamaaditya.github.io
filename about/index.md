### <a name="biography" id="biography"></a>Biography

I am a third year PhD Student at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/), Boston. My research focus is in application of [deep learning in problems of computer vision]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/research/). Before joining grad school I was a Senior Systems Engineer at [Infosys Limited](https://www.infosys.com/). I am from Kathmandu, [**Nepal**](https://media.gadventures.com/media-server/image_library/Nepal-Himalaya-Mountains-Annapurna-Pokhara-Prayer-Flags-IS-027332084-Lg-RGB.jpg). My [name means "Sun"]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/name/), and it is pronounced as "aaa--Dee--ti--ya". Other than research, I love [rock climbing]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/climbing/), running, [playing chess]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/chess/) and listening to classical Indian songs. 


## Current Research

### - Visual Question Answering - Supervisor - Prof. [James Storer](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/)
![Visual Question Answering]( http://visualqa.org/static/img/teaser_small.jpg )

* __Problem__: Given a color image of arbitrary size and question of arbitrary length, come up with the most reasonable answer (ground truth obtained from 10 amazon-turks responses)
* __Our approach__: 
  * Use of visual attention model along with end-to-end memory networks which are trained on skip-thought vectors on question tokens, and GoogLeNet dense layer image features. 
  * We are experimenting with application of Neural Turing Machines. We believe having a persistent memory will lead to sharing of knowledge between images where similar questions were asked. 
  * We are also experimenting to see if having spatial information could be useful in answering questions about location and direction. I am coding adaptation of CRF-RNN to extract spatial knowledge to be merged with image features.
* Current results are close to the state of the art, and we are in the top-5 in the [VisualQA Competition](http://visualqa.org/challenge.html). More details about results can be [obtained here]({{site.baseurl}}/research/).

### - Transfer learning
 
* We are investigating ideas for improving content based image retrieval through transfer learning. 
* We are currently exploring ways to retrieve [MIT Places](http://places.csail.mit.edu/) (scene recognition database) using deep residual image models like [ResNet - 2015 ImageNet challenge winner](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/ilsvrc15/ilsvrc2015_deep_residual_learning_kaiminghe.pdf). Our goal is to do ablation study on the 152 layers of ResNet for image retrieval task. 
* [Literature survey]({{site.baseurl}}/research/vector_quantization/) for compressing deep convolutional neural networks using vector quantization.

## Past Research
* * *

### - Computational Fact Checking [Summer 2014]  - Supervisor - [Prof. Liuba Shrira](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~liuba/)

* We investigated applications of computational fact checking on a database with retrospections.
* Implemented a fact checking application for database with weekly Music Billboards.

### - Self Organizing maps for large unstructured data [2013] - [Infosys Labs](http://www.infosysblogs.com/infosys-labs/bloggers.html) 
<br />
![SOM visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamaaditya/iamaaditya.github.io/master/images/som_image.png) 


* Formulated and designed a novel way to visualize self-organizing maps for unstructured big data.<br />
* Compared various forms of visual representation along with radar graphs and default visualization of self-organizing maps from most of the common packages in R and Matlab.<br />
* See Publication section for Abstract and PDF of the published work.


### - Distributed Simulated Annealing [2012] - [Infosys Labs](http://www.infosysblogs.com/infosys-labs/bloggers.html) 

* Studied industry scaled distributed simulated annealing and issues that arise when dealing with large scale optimization.
* Presented fault tolerance techniques for such a system designed for MapReduce infrastructure running on Apache Hadoop.
* See Publication section for Abstract and PDF of the published work.
