I am an independent researcher with interests in Â computational mathematics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and non-linear systems.

You may want to see [this page][1] for my research details. For more general bio, see the main page <http://aaditya.info>

I love to read, code, solve, play chess and listen to music. Would love to hear from anyone who shares similar interests.

If you are wondering what &#8220;if(e^i*pi) printf(&#8220;P=NP&#8221;);&#8221; means, then for completeness *(not the NP kind)*, let me explain.

**Math**  
e^i*pi + 1 = 0, is called [Euler&#8217;s Identity][2] and most widely recognized mathematical formula. Some (like Sal Khan of khanacademy.org) consider it be one of the secrets of universe which we haven&#8217;t unraveled yet.

**Programming**  
printf(), is the one of most widely used C statement and every coder (who has programmed C or C++) has written it over and over again. For those who don&#8217;t know C or programming, [printf][3] is used to print any text/number to the screen.

**Computer Science**  
P=NP, (or P!=NP), is the most challenging problem in Theoretical Computer Science. While most of the empirical evidence and poll of computer scientists suggest that P!=NP, but the proof eludes us. May be like Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem, this one will take years and collaborative effort and yet produce non-elegant proof nonetheless there are thousands if not millions are looking for it. If you want more info see the wiki, [P versus NP][4] and also, [List of unsolved problems in computer science][5]. If you have no clue what I am talking about, please see the movie &#8220;[Travelling Salesman (2012)][6]&#8221;

These three subjects underlay all of my work and most of my life.
